# Cultivate a weekly saving habit via GoodGhosting on Twitter (Polygon only)

[https://youtu.be/oVQVkZlEE8U](https://youtu.be/oVQVkZlEE8U)

GoodGhosting is a lossless savings game, with some friendly competition. By joining a social savings pool, you commit to saving towards a fixed goal.  Regular savers - who reach the goal - are rewarded more than people who do not. At the end of the month, everyone gets their initial deposit back. But only the winning players earn extra rewards. This means you earn higher interest rates than when you would save by yourself.

For example, in a hypothetical game, where participants have to save 20 DAI per week and 80 DAI for the month (4 rounds) for $5 reward. You will end up with at least $85 if you make all 4 weeks . If the game starts with 500 people participating and only 250 people finish, then the half who didn't finish will give up their interest to the half who finished. The finished half will end up with $80+5+5=$90 for each person

1. To better understand how everyone is doing, let's go to the **everyone page**. You can see there are 4 types. 
- Since we are at Round 2, winning means the person has made 2 deposits.
- Waiting means this person only made deposit for round 1 and hasn't commit for round 2 yet.
- Drop-outs means the person did commit once but has already withdrawn.
- Ghosts means that the person committed for round 1, but is no where to be found for round 2 and will be deemed Ghost after the start of Round 3 (if there is a round 3).
