# Display the NFTs you own on your Twitter profile

In v1.36.1 and later versions of the Mask extension, users could check the NFT gallery at their own Twitter profile page, or other's profile page.

Users who meet one of the four requirements below could have their NFTs displayed:

1. Their Twitter nickname is their ENS
2. Their Twitter bio contains ENS
3. Their Twitter bio contains a validated address
4. Their Twitter id + “.eth” form their ENS

After meeting one of the four requirements above, the users could see their NFT Gallery as below:

Note: The ENS relies on ETH. If the current network is not ETH, then ENS cannot check NFT, therefore the "NFTs" tab will show "No collectible found"
